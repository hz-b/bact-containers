Starting the twin
=================

After everything has been built, start the container
`thor-scsi-lib-as-twin.sif`. To do so change into the directory `bin`.

.. code:: shell

   cd bin

There you will find the container, given that it was successfully built.
Now all you need to do is to start it by executing it

..code:: shell

   thor-scsi-lib-as-twin.sif

This will automatically start the twin.
It is using an epics input output controller (IOC).
